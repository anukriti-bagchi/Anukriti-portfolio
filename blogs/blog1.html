    </header>
      <p>Much like silence, I believe, liberation is a state of mind. 
        This should not come as a surprise to us since ideas are nothing but an abstraction of the human mind; most of them can be materialized.
        I think of a wall and I can build it. I think of democracy and I can establish it. I can think of a revolution and I can bring it to life.
        Liberty, however, is complex.</p>

        <br>
     
    <p>They can pass multiple laws that let us do what we couldn‚Äôt before and many of us still won‚Äôt do it. It took the French commoners years to adapt themselves to the newfound freedom. Significant events only lay the foundation for liberation, which then gradually seeps in through the societies and then individuals.
       We all know slavery didn‚Äôt end with the American Civil War.</p>

       <br>

  <p>And I think it is safe to say that if our American and French folks- apart from their weird sense of fashion- were similar to us. My parents could tell me that the whole eating-vegetarian-food because the gods like us that way and I still wouldn‚Äôt do it right away. Not until I truly feel I can do it. We, the successful products of our overly restrictive societies live all our lives fearing what others would think of us. 
      At least until that one event that liberates us.</p>

      <br>

  <p>People go away on vacations to ‚Äòfeel free‚Äô only to realize they wasted worth 2 months‚Äô salary while I could be sitting in public transport and feel it.
       And so much for the association of liberation with breaking chains and setting free- I feel most free when I return home, inside my four walls and so does half the living population!</p>


       <br>
  <p>Life is, indeed, full of ironies.</p>
